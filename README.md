#Kool-Keyboards

A React.js-powered ecommerce website that shows keyboards to sell. The UI features components made from React.js, I used the Redux library for state management, Node and Express for the backend, Express-sessions and Passport.js for user authentication, and React-Slider for the sliding animation in the home page. This is a fully functioning MERN Stack app!
